# LinkLens Platform Starter (Next.js + Supabase)

Dark, minimal LinkLens starter with:

- Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase auth (email magic link)
- Onboarding flow that saves a profile to the `profiles` table
- Sample creators page (placeholder until wired to DB)

Key routes:

- `/` — marketing-style home
- `/auth` — sign in with email (Supabase magic link)
- `/onboarding` — create profile (role, bio, IG, portfolio)
- `/creators` — sample marketplace view

See `README_SUPABASE_STEP_BY_STEP.md` for a super basic walkthrough.
